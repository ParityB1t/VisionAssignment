9343 AM.bmp

size of 1 cell on average 40x40 pixels
edge goes in a clutter pattern, within clutter, distance between edges is roughly distance of 5 pixels, direction varies with this distance

so we want gaussian filter < 40
standard deviation 


size < 40 cuz pixel size
size ~5 cuz distance and we don't to take into account other cells

try smaller than 5 won't remove noise

don't know about standard devision value correspondance to the weight given, generally more means more weight is given to the outer pixels, in this case don't know yet if that will be better or worse, so experiement

they can really benefit from edge thinning

Thresholding - looked at matrix and image and determine

Sobel
